# gaussian mle

Code for visualizing the log of a Gaussian Probability Density Function, and finding it's mean and standard deviation with a from-scratch implemented maximum likelihood estimator. 

The parameterized mu and sigma output from the MLE are verified by computing the sample mean and sample variance in the following forms:

\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} X[n]
