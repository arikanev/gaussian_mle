# gaussian mle

Code for visualizing the log of a Gaussian Probability Density Function, and finding it's mean and standard deviation with a from-scratch implemented maximum likelihood estimator. 

The parameterized mu and sigma output from the MLE are verified by computing the sample mean and sample variance in the following forms:

If running from command line you can parameterize the initial gaussian that MLE will be run against with -mu, and -sigma.
